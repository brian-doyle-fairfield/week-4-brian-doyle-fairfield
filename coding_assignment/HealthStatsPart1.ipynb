    "*Waist to Hip Ratio* is one of the many calculations doctors use to determine whether or not a patient is overweight. This helps doctors assess if a patient's weight may be putting them at certain health risks. The ratio compares your waist circumference to your hip circumference. Essentially, it determines how much fat is stored in the area in and around your waist and hips.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Your *Waist to Hip Ratio* can be calculated by dividing your waist circumference by your hip circumference as follows: \n",
    "\n",
